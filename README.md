# Elm motion

A small experiment with animation in Elm. How to take an existing model,
a description of how a property might change over time, then update
it only by sending in time increments.

**NB:** This was developed for Elm 0.17.
Please see https://github.com/Rcsuax/elm-motion for a fork that works with
Elm 0.18.
